# Bluetooth_device_battery_level_alert

This CLI based program searches for nearby bluetooth devices, lets you pair with compatible bluetooth devices (EX: bluetooth headphones) and sends an email alert if the connected device's battery level is less than that is implemented in the code.

This program utilizes Gmail's API to send email and also https://github.com/TheWeirdDev/Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level to read battery level of the connected bluetooth device.

This program can be used for automation.

PLEASE MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM BEFORE RUNNING (EX: email-id, password).
